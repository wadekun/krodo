"""Symbol index Protocol + value objects (architecture.md §5 — M9 data foundation).

This module is the **single contract** that M10 (repo-map) and M11 (symbol
tools) consume. M9 ships one concrete implementation
(:class:`~krodo.indexer.symbol_index.TreeSitterSymbolIndex`, ``backend="treesitter"``);
Phase 3 will add an LSP backend (``backend="lsp"``, ``precision="semantic"``)
without touching this Protocol or its dataclasses.

Design notes (see ``docs/reviews/m9_plan_review.md`` — review A):

* ``backend`` records *which* backend produced a symbol on a Composite chain
  (so callers can tell a tree-sitter hit from an LSP hit at query time).
* ``precision`` is ``"syntactic"`` for tree-sitter (node-text based) and will be
  ``"semantic"`` for LSP (resolved via the language server). M9 always emits
  ``"syntactic"`` — zero runtime cost, but the field is reserved now so that
  adding the LSP backend is non-breaking.
* All ``path`` values are **relative to the workspace root** (POSIX-style) so
  that the index is portable across machines and survives a workspace move.
